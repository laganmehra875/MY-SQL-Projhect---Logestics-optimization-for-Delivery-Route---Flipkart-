## KEY FINDINGS :

1. Delivery delays are a major operational challenge
Flipkart faces delays caused by congestion, hub/warehouse processing issues, traffic disruptions, and route inefficiencies. 


2. Route inefficiencies impact cost and customer experience
Inefficient routes and inconsistent travel times increase delivery time and reduce operational efficiency. 


3. Warehouses differ in processing capacity and speed
Some warehouses may have higher processing times, causing bottlenecks in the supply chain. 


4. Delivery agent performance varies significantly
Differences in speed, experience, and on-time delivery rates affect overall shipment success. 


5. Shipment tracking data reveals frequent delay patterns
Multiple delay checkpoints and common delay reasons highlight gaps in real-time logistics execution. 


6. SQL-based analytics can uncover actionable insights
The project aims to leverage SQL to clean data, analyze delays, optimize routing, review agent and warehouse performance, and produce KPIs. 


## RECOMMENDATIONS :

1. Optimize delivery routes using traffic and delay data
Identify high-delay routes and redesign them with alternative paths, time-based scheduling, or dynamic routing. 


2. Improve warehouse operational efficiency
Warehouses with higher processing times should implement workflow restructuring, better staffing, or automation tools. 


3. Enhance agent training and performance management
Agents with <80% on-time delivery should receive training or workload balancing based on experience and speed metrics. 


4. Use real-time shipment tracking to reduce delays
Monitor common delay reasons and set up alerts for checkpoints where delays occur frequently. 


5. Implement KPI dashboards for continuous monitoring
Track delivery delay per region, on-time delivery %, warehouse processing averages, and route traffic delay to support decision-making. 


6. Prioritize high-volume and high-delay zones for immediate intervention
Focus route planning and warehouse upgrades in metro, Tier-2, and Tier-3 regions with high order density. 


## CONCLUSION :

The project aims to strengthen Flipkart’s logistics by using SQL-driven analytics to identify delivery delays, reveal route inefficiencies, assess warehouse and agent performance, and improve shipment tracking.
By cleaning and analyzing the logistics datasets, Flipkart can build a data-backed optimization strategy that reduces delays, enhances route efficiency, boosts warehouse productivity, and improves customer satisfaction. The actionable insights generated through this project—supported by KPIs and performance reports—will enable smarter operational decisions and long-term logistics optimization.
